Hybrid video coding is an advanced coding technique which is derived from both predictive coding and  transform coding. Hybrid video coding framework is commonly used in modern video coding  standards, e.g., H.26x, MPEG2/4, AVS, HEVC, etc. In this project, a simplified hybrid video codec  with coding tools like discrete cosine transformation (DCT), quantization, prediction, and entropy  coding are implemented and the impact of each tool on the codecâ€™s performance is investigated. Quantization will be done with 3 levels of quantization values. The video coding component comprises  of macro block-based coding, basic motion estimation and intra prediction as well. The third part of the  project focuses on an Improved hybrid video codec. There, the quantisation process of the codec is  expected to be optimized to facilitate transmission in fixed bandwidth environment and obtaining the  best QP to meet the given bit-rate.
